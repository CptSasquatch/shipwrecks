### Team Members

* Name: **Sam Song**

### Project Description

In this project, we will be analyzing data on shipwrecks in North America. We will be using the data to answer questions such as:

* What is the distribution of shipwrecks in North America?
* What are the conditions in areas with the most shipwrecks?
* How do shipwrecks relate to other data sets?

### Interactive Visualization

We will be using the following interactive visualization to display our data:

* leaflet map with heat map showing shipwreck locations
* button that allows user to randomly select 50 shipwrecks and display them on the map
* tooltip that displays information about the shipwreck when the user clicks a shipwreck
* an interactive bar chart that allows the user to select a shipwreck feature and display the percentage of shipwrecks that have that feature
* a scatter plot that allows the user to select a feature and display the relationship between that feature and the year the shipwrecks occurred

### Data Sources

* [Coast Survey's Automated Wreck and Obstruction Information System (AWOIS)](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/wrecks-and-obstructions.html#:~:text=Coast%20Survey's%20Automated%20Wreck%20and,brief%20historic%20and%20descriptive%20details.)

### Project Scope

* we will use a a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js to create the interactive visualization
* we will use a SQLite database to store the data
* we will use the following Python libraries: pandas, sqlalchemy, flask, and requests
* we will use the following JavaScript libraries: d3.js, leaflet.js, easy-button.js, leaflet-heat.js
* we will use the following HTML/CSS libraries: leaflet.css, easy-button.css
